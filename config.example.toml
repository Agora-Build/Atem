# Atem Configuration Example
# Copy to ~/.config/atem/config.toml and customize

# Agora Console credentials (get from console.agora.io > RESTful API)
customer_id = "your_customer_id_here"
customer_secret = "your_customer_secret_here"

# RTM configuration for voice coding
rtm_channel = "atem_channel"
rtm_account = "atem01"

# === Astation Connection ===

# Local WebSocket URL for direct Astation connection
# Default: ws://127.0.0.1:8080/ws (same machine)
#
# For VPN connections (Netbird, Tailscale, ZeroTier):
# 1. Find your Astation machine's VPN IP:
#    - Netbird: Look in Netbird UI or run `netbird status`
#    - Tailscale: Run `tailscale ip -4`
#    - ZeroTier: Check ZeroTier Central or run `zerotier-cli listnetworks`
# 2. Set astation_ws to ws://<vpn-ip>:8080/ws
#
# Examples:
# astation_ws = "ws://127.0.0.1:8080/ws"          # Same machine (default)
# astation_ws = "ws://192.168.1.5:8080/ws"        # LAN IP
# astation_ws = "ws://100.64.0.2:8080/ws"         # Netbird IP
# astation_ws = "ws://100.100.100.5:8080/ws"      # Tailscale IP
# astation_ws = "ws://10.147.20.15:8080/ws"       # ZeroTier IP

# Station relay URL for remote connections (fallback when local fails)
# Use HTTP/HTTPS base URL - will be converted to ws:// or wss:// automatically
# Examples:
# astation_relay_url = "https://station.agora.build"    # Default
# astation_relay_url = "http://100.117.91.44:8080"      # Custom relay server

# Astation ID for relay routing (required for relay connections)
# This is the unique identifier of your Astation instance.
# Get it from: ~/Library/Application Support/Astation/identity.txt (on macOS)
# With this configured, relay connections use sessions (no pairing needed after first time)
#
# Example:
# astation_relay_code = "astation-abc123-def456-..."

# === Connection Priority ===
# 1. Try astation_ws (local/LAN/VPN) with session auth → seamless
# 2. Try astation_ws direct → no auth needed for localhost
# 3. Try relay with session auth → seamless remote (requires astation_relay_code)
# 4. Try relay with pairing code → explicit approval required (legacy fallback)
